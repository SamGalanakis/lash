# E2E Scenario: Workbench Failure Paths

> **Read [../RULES.md](../RULES.md) first.** Its browser, polling, screenshot,
> Abort/RCA, and teardown rules apply. This runbook names a deliberate exception to the
> real-token rule: the Workbench's opt-in development failure provider.

**Purpose.** Judge what a user sees when provider authentication fails mid-turn, a
retryable rate limit causes an attempt reset, and a durable Runtime Process fails. Each
fault is deterministic so the visible wording and final state are objective gates.

**Deterministic companion.** `just agent-workbench-restate-e2e` asserts the auth terminal,
same-session recovery, retry attempt reset, and single-copy live/replay observations.
`cargo test -p agent-workbench process_work_tests` asserts the failed-process `/api/work`
projection and UI error rendering. The browser run judges the actual transcript and work
rail; it does not reproduce those internal assertions.

## Scenario-specific golden rules

1. Set `AGENT_WORKBENCH_DEV_PROVIDER_SCENARIO` to exactly the phase's documented value.
   Require the startup warning and rendered model id `dev/failure-paths`; an OpenRouter
   request or missing warning invalidates the run.
2. Use a fresh data directory and a fresh port-derived stack for each scenario. Never
   carry provider call counts, sessions, or processes between phases.
3. A provider error is a stopped `ProviderError`, never `Cancelled`. It must settle,
   render its real error, clear the active route, and leave the same session usable.
4. Retry output is replace-not-append. The final rendered assistant response and
   `/api/state.messages` contain `retry observer single-copy marker` exactly once.
5. Process failure remains process failure. The work rail must show `failed` plus the
   durable error; a successful parent turn must not make the process look successful.

## Working material

- For each phase choose `<port>` and `<fresh-data-dir>`, then boot:
  `AGENT_WORKBENCH_DEV_PROVIDER_SCENARIO=<scenario> AGENT_WORKBENCH_DATA_DIR=<fresh-data-dir> AGENT_WORKBENCH_OPEN=0 just agent-workbench <port>`.
  No provider key is required. Gate `GET /healthz` → 200 and retain the startup log.
- Browser affordances: model selector, session id, composer, running/idle pill,
  transcript, and **work** rail.
- Backend truth: `GET /api/state`, `POST /api/turn`, `GET /api/work`, and the observation
  stream used by the page. Disk truth: `<fresh-data-dir>/trace.jsonl` and
  `active-turns.json`.
- End every phase with `just agent-workbench-down <port>` and confirm its managed Restate
  container is gone before reusing the port.

## Phase 0 — Common pre-flight

For the selected scenario, poll `/healthz`, open the page, and require the rendered model
id to be `dev/failure-paths`. Require the startup log to name
`AGENT_WORKBENCH_DEV_PROVIDER_SCENARIO` and the exact scenario. Require a fresh transcript,
no active turn, and the idle pill. Screenshot `00-<scenario>-ready.png`.

## Phase 1 — Authentication failure, honest terminal, recovery

Boot with `auth-failure-once`. Submit `trigger deterministic auth failure`. Poll until the
page is idle and Stop is hidden, then gate all of:

- the transcript visibly renders `development provider rejected credentials mid-turn`
  as an error/event, with no assistant success bubble for that turn;
- `/api/state.active_turns` is empty and `active-turns.json` contains no route;
- the trace's completed turn has `outcome` stopped with `provider_error`, contains issue
  code `dev_auth_rejected`, and has no cancellation evidence or cancelled outcome.

Save state and matching trace rows as `01-auth-failed-state.json` and
`01-auth-failed-trace.json`; screenshot `01-auth-failed.png`.

Without resetting or restarting, record the session id, submit `prove recovery`, and poll
for the exact assistant text `session recovered after provider auth failure`. Require the
session id to be unchanged, the page idle, and no active route. Screenshot
`02-auth-session-recovered.png` and save `/api/state` as
`02-auth-session-recovered-state.json`.

Teardown this stack before Phase 2.

## Phase 2 — Retryable rate limit, one-copy convergence

Boot fresh with `rate-limit-once`. Start browser network/event capture before submitting
`trigger deterministic rate limit retry`; this captures transient observations without
using a fixed sleep. Poll until the exact terminal assistant text
`provider retry succeeded` is rendered and the page is idle.

Require the final rendered assistant response and `/api/state.messages` each contain
`retry observer single-copy marker` exactly once. In captured observations or trace
evidence require one retry caused by `dev_rate_limited` and one
`model_attempt_reset`; after applying that reset by its correlation ids, one marker
remains. Require no error terminal, no cancellation evidence, and no active route.

Screenshot `03-rate-limit-recovered.png`; save state, observations, and trace rows as
`03-rate-limit-state.json`, `03-rate-limit-observations.jsonl`, and
`03-rate-limit-trace.json`. Teardown before Phase 3.

## Phase 3 — Failed durable process in the work rail

Boot fresh with `failed-process`. Submit `start deterministic failing process`; the parent
turn may finish successfully. Poll `GET /api/work` until the row labelled
`FIG425_deterministic_failure` is terminal with status `failed` and error exactly
`deterministic durable process failure`.

Open the **work** rail and poll until that same row visibly shows both `failed` and
`error: deterministic durable process failure`. The UI and `/api/work` must identify the
same process id. Screenshot `04-failed-process-work-rail.png`; save the API row as
`04-failed-process.json`.

## Phase 4 — Teardown and score

Tear down the final stack and confirm all three managed Restate containers were removed.

| Item | Objective gate | Verdict | Evidence |
|------|----------------|---------|----------|
| Dev-only fixture | exact scenario warning + `dev/failure-paths`; no network provider | | `00-*-ready.png`, startup logs |
| Auth failure | rendered exact error; ProviderError trace; no Cancelled evidence | | `01-auth-failed.*` |
| Session recovery | same session commits the exact recovery response | | `02-auth-session-recovered.*` |
| Retry convergence | one reset and one surviving marker in UI/API/observations | | `03-rate-limit-*` |
| Durable failure | work rail and `/api/work` agree on failed + exact error | | `04-failed-process-*` |
| Route hygiene | every settled phase has no active route | | saved state and `active-turns.json` |
| Teardown | each port-derived stack is gone | | command log |

**Aggregate:** did every failure class settle honestly, stay observable at the user
surface, avoid duplicate retry output, and preserve a usable session?
