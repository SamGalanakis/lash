# E2E Scenario: Workbench Turn Ingress — Inject Now vs Queue Next

> **Read [../RULES.md](../RULES.md) first** — especially the browser-surface,
> objective-gate, screenshot, token, Abort/RCA, and teardown rules. This runbook adds only
> the turn-ingress scenario.

**Purpose.** Prove that a downstream host can submit user input while a workbench turn is
running with either Lash ingress contract: inject it exactly once into the in-flight turn,
or preserve it as a draft that commits as a separate next turn after the current turn
settles. The rendered intent, HTTP receipt, durable row, trace, and provider evidence must
all name the same operation.

**Real tokens.** The browser run uses OpenRouter, so timing and prose are nondeterministic.
Gate on durable input identities, ingress scopes, turn boundaries, and provider/trace
structure rather than exact assistant wording.

## Scenario-specific golden rules

1. **Submit both inputs during one proven running turn.** Gate the running pill, **stop
   turn** control, and exactly one `/api/state.active_turns` address before using either
   ingress action. A receipt outside that window does not prove mid-turn behavior.
2. **Intent and render must agree.** **inject now** must render `injected now` and return
   `ingress.scope: "active_turn"` targeting the exact active turn with
   `min_boundary: "after_work"`. **queue next** must render `queued next` and return
   `ingress.scope: "next_turn"`. Each rendered row carries the receipt's `input_id`.
3. **The durable row is authoritative before claim.** Reconcile each receipt against
   `/api/state.pending_turn_inputs` and the session SQLite `lash_pending_turn_inputs` row.
   A claim may make a row disappear from the pending API quickly; in that case use the
   SQLite row plus trace, never timing alone.
4. **Injection is transient and exactly once.** Provider-request evidence may show the
   injected marker directly. Otherwise require exactly one `turn_input.completed` trace
   claim for the receipt's input id under the original in-flight turn id. It must never
   appear in committed transcript history or the later queued turn.
5. **Queued means a full committed turn.** The queued marker must be absent from provider
   requests until the first turn settles, then appear in its own provider request and in
   committed session history. `/api/state` and the rendered transcript must show that
   committed user/assistant pair.
6. **Do not substitute ordinary Send.** The initial turn uses **send**; the two mid-turn
   inputs use their named running-turn controls and `POST /api/turn/input` only.

## Working material

- Boot with a fresh data directory:
  `AGENT_WORKBENCH_DATA_DIR=<fresh-tmp> AGENT_WORKBENCH_OPEN=0 just agent-workbench <port>`.
  Gate `GET /healthz` → 200. Teardown with `just agent-workbench-down <port>`.
- UI: composer, **inject now**, **queue next**, ingress receipt rows, transcript, running
  pill, and Stop control.
- HTTP truth: `GET /api/state`, `POST /api/turn`, and `POST /api/turn/input` with
  `{ "text": "...", "ingress": "active_turn" | "next_turn" }`.
- Disk truth: `<data-dir>/lash-sessions/*.db`, table `pending_turn_inputs`, and
  `<data-dir>/trace.jsonl` events named `agent_workbench.turn_input.enqueued` and
  `turn_input.completed`.
- The deterministic companion gate is `just agent-workbench-restate-e2e`. It proves the
  active input id completes exactly once under the in-flight turn, the queued draft
  dispatches only after settle, and runs Lash core's ADR 0029 session-lease-generation
  fencing test.

## Phase 0 — Boot and pre-flight

Require `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`; missing credentials are a harness gap → Abort. Boot, gate
readiness, open the browser, and confirm the rendered session id equals
`/api/state.settings.session_id`. Confirm the idle composer offers **send**, not the two
running-turn actions. Screenshot `00-idle.png`.

Choose unique literal markers for this run, for example
`FIG425-INJECT-<nonce>` and `FIG425-QUEUE-<nonce>`, and record them in the scorecard.

## Phase 1 — Establish an in-flight turn

Send a task likely to create multiple provider/tool boundaries, such as a current web
research comparison that must use `web.search` twice before answering. Poll, do not sleep,
until all three gates hold:

- the UI shows the running pill and **stop turn**;
- the composer offers **inject now** and **queue next**;
- `/api/state.active_turns` has exactly one address for the rendered session.

Record that address and screenshot `01-running.png`.

## Phase 2 — Inject into the running turn

Enter the injection marker with a short instruction that the final response acknowledge
it, then press **inject now** while capturing `POST /api/turn/input`.

Gate the response: `accepted: true`, non-empty `input_id`, state `pending_active`, and an
`active_turn` ingress whose `turn_id` equals Phase 1 and whose minimum boundary is
`after_work`. Gate the page renders an `injected now` row with the marker and the same
input id in its element data. Reconcile the receipt with `/api/state.pending_turn_inputs`
or, if already claimed, its SQLite row and `agent_workbench.turn_input.enqueued` trace.

Save `02-inject-receipt.json`, the matching disk row as
`02-inject-store.json`, and screenshot `02-injected.png`.

## Phase 3 — Queue a separate next turn

Before the running turn settles, enter the queue marker with a self-contained instruction
and press **queue next**, capturing the response. Gate `accepted: true`, a different
non-empty `input_id`, state `deferred_next_turn`, and `ingress.scope: "next_turn"`.
Gate the page renders a separate `queued next` row carrying that id and marker. Reconcile
against the pending API or SQLite row and trace as in Phase 2.

Save `03-queue-receipt.json`, `03-queue-store.json`, and screenshot `03-queued.png`.

## Phase 4 — Settle and prove both semantics

Poll until the initial turn completes and the queued turn starts and completes; never use
a fixed delay. Gate in this order:

1. provider-request evidence places the injected marker in the initial turn, or exactly
   one `turn_input.completed` trace claim places its input id under the initial turn id;
2. that marker is absent from the committed transcript in `/api/state` and the session
   store;
3. the queued marker is absent from every provider request before the initial terminal;
4. a later provider request contains the queued marker and begins only after that terminal;
5. the queued marker is a committed user message in the durable session read model, the
   UI and `/api/state` render it, and it has its own assistant result;
6. neither input remains pending, and the SQLite lifecycle rows are completed rather than
   duplicated or abandoned.

Save ordered provider/trace evidence as `04-provider-order.json`, committed store evidence
as `04-session-history.json`, and screenshot `04-two-turns-settled.png` with the latest
transcript rows visible.

## Phase 5 — Teardown and score

Run `just agent-workbench-down <port>` and confirm both the workbench and its Restate
container are gone.

| Item | Objective gate | Verdict | Evidence |
|------|----------------|---------|----------|
| Boot | `/healthz` 200; rendered/API session ids agree | | `00-idle.png` |
| Running window | one active address; both ingress controls visible | | `01-running.png`, `/api/state` |
| Inject intent | UI label and receipt agree on exact active turn + `after_work` | | `02-injected.png`, receipt/store JSON |
| Queue intent | UI label and receipt agree on `next_turn` | | `03-queued.png`, receipt/store JSON |
| Exactly-once injection | one initial-turn provider delivery or one matching completion claim; never committed/later | | `04-provider-order.json`, session store |
| Post-settle dispatch | queue marker first appears after initial terminal in its own turn | | provider/trace ordering |
| Transcript fidelity | queued user/assistant turn agrees across UI, `/api/state`, and store | | `04-two-turns-settled.png`, history JSON |
| Claim settlement | both durable input ids settle with no duplicate or stranded row | | SQLite evidence |

**Aggregate:** did the host-selected ingress operation match the rendered intent and
durable evidence, with one transient injection and one later committed full turn?
