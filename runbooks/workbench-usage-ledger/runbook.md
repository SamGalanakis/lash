# E2E Scenario: Workbench Usage Ledger — API, Render, Trace, Restart

> **Read [../RULES.md](../RULES.md) first** — especially the browser-surface,
> screenshot, polling, real-token, Abort/RCA, and teardown rules. This runbook adds only
> the usage-ledger scenario.

**Purpose.** Prove that the workbench renders Lash's canonical persisted
`SessionUsageReport`, that its counters reconcile with completed LLM calls in the trace,
and that replacing the web process does not reset or mutate the ledger.

**Real tokens.** The browser turn uses OpenRouter, so exact counts vary. Gate on positive
provider-reported counters, canonical arithmetic, and equality between surfaces.

## Scenario-specific golden rules

1. **Use the canonical report.** `/api/state.usage` is `session.usage_report()`, not a
   browser accumulator. Save the entire object before comparing the rendered rail.
2. **Reasoning output is a subset.** For API and trace rows, total tokens are
   `input_tokens + output_tokens + cache_read_input_tokens + cache_write_input_tokens`.
   Never add `reasoning_output_tokens` again.
3. **Reconcile only this turn's trace window.** Record the trace byte offset or record
   count immediately before send. Sum `usage` from every later `llm_call_completed` record
   belonging to the chosen turn, including multiple RLM iterations. Treat the recorded
   boundary as a scan start and apply the turn id as the decisive filter, because idle
   polling can advance the trace file.
4. **Totals dominate rows/calls.** API session totals must equal the sum of
   `by_source_model` rows and be greater than or equal to this turn's completed-call sum.
   Input and output must be non-zero when the trace reports calls.
5. **Restart equality is exact.** After `agent-workbench-restart`, require the full
   `/api/state.usage` JSON object and rendered total/input/output strings to equal the
   pre-restart values. Monotonic-but-different is a failure when no new call ran.

## Working material

- First run `just agent-workbench-attachment-usage-gate <port>`. Its deterministic
  provider reports fixed non-zero usage, the gate reconciles one `llm_call_completed`
  record, reconstructs the core, and executes against both SQLite and Postgres
  session-store backends on a port-derived managed database.
- Boot with a fresh directory:
  `AGENT_WORKBENCH_DATA_DIR=<fresh-tmp> AGENT_WORKBENCH_OPEN=0 just agent-workbench <port>`.
  Require `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`; missing credentials are a harness gap → Abort. Teardown is
  `just agent-workbench-down <port>`.
- UI truth: left-rail **usage** total and **tokens** input/output rows, transcript,
  running/idle pill.
- API truth: `GET /api/state`, especially `usage.usage`, `usage.by_source_model`, and
  `usage.entry_count`.
- Disk truth: `<data-dir>/trace.jsonl` and the selected SQLite/Postgres session store.

## Phase 0 — Boot and capture the baseline

Poll `/healthz`, open the browser, and require the rendered/API/disk session ids to agree.
Save `/api/state` as `00-baseline-state.json`, record the current trace boundary, and
require the rendered **usage** and **tokens** values to equal the baseline report (normally
zero in a fresh directory). Screenshot `00-baseline.png`.

## Phase 1 — Run one attributable turn

Send a short deterministic-shaped instruction with a unique marker, for example:
`Reply with exactly FIG425-USAGE-<run-id> and do not call tools.` Poll until the UI is idle,
`/api/state.active_turns` is empty, and the committed user/assistant pair is present. Do
not gate on the assistant obeying the exact prose constraint; it only identifies the turn.

Save the settled state as `01-settled-state.json` and screenshot the fully scrolled
transcript plus usage rail as `01-usage-rendered.png`.

## Phase 2 — Reconcile API, render, and trace

From trace records after the Phase 0 boundary, select every `llm_call_completed` record for
the marker's turn and save them as `02-llm-calls.json`. Require at least one completed call
and a positive canonical call sum. Then gate:

- `/api/state.usage.entry_count == usage.by_source_model.length`;
- the canonical session total equals the sum of every `by_source_model[].usage.total_tokens`;
- each report row is no larger than the session total;
- the session total is at least the sum of the selected trace call usage;
- report input total (uncached + cache read + cache write) and output are non-zero wherever
  the selected calls report non-zero values;
- rendered **usage** is the locale-formatted API `total_tokens` plus `total`;
- rendered **tokens** is the locale-formatted API input total plus `in ·`, followed by API
  `output_tokens` plus `out`.

Save the normalized arithmetic as `02-reconciliation.json`. Any rendered/API/trace
disagreement is a contract violation → Abort/RCA.

## Phase 3 — Replace the process and prove persistence

Run `just agent-workbench-restart <port>` and poll `/healthz`. Require the PID to change
while session identity remains fixed. Reload the browser without submitting a turn. Save
the new state as `03-restarted-state.json` and require its complete `usage` object to equal
`01-settled-state.json.usage`. Require the two rendered usage rows to be text-identical to
Phase 2. Screenshot `03-usage-persisted.png`.

Also require that no new `llm_call_started` or `llm_call_completed` trace record appeared
solely because of restart/state loading.

## Phase 4 — Teardown and score

Run `just agent-workbench-down <port>` and confirm the workbench and its managed services
are gone.

| Item | Objective gate | Verdict | Evidence |
|------|----------------|---------|----------|
| Deterministic companion | fixed-usage SQLite + Postgres gate exits zero | | command log |
| Settled turn | one committed pair and at least one completed LLM call | | `01-*`, `02-llm-calls.json` |
| Report arithmetic | totals equal row sum and dominate selected call sum | | `02-reconciliation.json` |
| Non-zero usage | call/report input and output are positive where calls occurred | | state + trace JSON |
| Render agreement | usage and token rail text exactly formats API counters | | `01-usage-rendered.png` |
| Restart persistence | PID changed; complete usage object and rail text are unchanged | | `03-*`, command log |
| Restart side effects | restart/state load emits no LLM call | | trace boundary evidence |

**Aggregate:** did the rendered token ledger agree with canonical API and trace arithmetic,
then survive a cold web-process restart without drift or hidden calls?
