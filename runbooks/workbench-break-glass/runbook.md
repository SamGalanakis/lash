# E2E Scenario: Workbench Break-Glass Operator Flow

> **Read [../RULES.md](../RULES.md) first.** Its browser, polling, evidence,
> Abort/RCA, and teardown rules apply. This runbook uses the documented Restate Admin
> `KILL` deliberately; unlike ordinary Stop runbooks, that is the fault under test.

**Purpose.** Wedge one foreground turn in the local exec-blocked shape described by
[ADR 0039](../../docs/adr/0039-turn-cancellation-is-a-first-party-work-driver-primitive.md), force-kill its
Restate invocation, then judge whether Workbench tells the truth: no fabricated
`Cancelled`, bounded Stop clears the dangling route with an unknown terminal, and the
same session can run its next turn.

**Store-side companion, not repeated here.** `just restate-postgres-workers-e2e` includes
the `break-glass-negative` gate: after an admin kill, the durable store has neither a
fabricated terminal result nor a Lash `Cancelled` terminal. Run or cite that gate as
scripted evidence. This runbook covers only the operator and browser story.

## Scenario-specific golden rules

1. Boot only with `AGENT_WORKBENCH_DEV_PROVIDER_SCENARIO=exec-blocked`. Its first call
   emits a ten-minute foreground Lashlang sleep; its second call deterministically
   finishes `session recovered after break glass`.
2. Identify the exact `WorkbenchTurnWorkflow` invocation by the active turn id. Never
   kill by service prefix, most-recent guess, container, or process id.
3. Use Restate Admin `PATCH /invocations/<id>/kill`, not cooperative cancel. KILL is
   owner destruction, not cancellation evidence, and must never produce a rendered or
   durable `Cancelled` result.
4. Press Workbench **stop turn** only after Restate reports the invocation non-active.
   The expected bounded receipt has no terminal and has
   `terminal_error.code = turn_terminal_await_timeout`; this is a passing break-glass
   result, not a successful cancellation.
5. Recovery must reuse the original session. Allow up to 90 seconds for lease fencing
   and successor acquisition, but poll throughout—never sleep to decide readiness.

## Working material

- Choose `<port>` and `<fresh-data-dir>`, then boot:
  `AGENT_WORKBENCH_DEV_PROVIDER_SCENARIO=exec-blocked AGENT_WORKBENCH_DATA_DIR=<fresh-data-dir> AGENT_WORKBENCH_OPEN=0 just agent-workbench <port>`.
- The helper derives `offset=<port>-3030`, Restate ingress port `8080+offset`, and Restate
  admin port `19070+offset`. Record `ADMIN=http://127.0.0.1:<derived-admin-port>` rather
  than assuming the default port.
- UI: session id, composer, running/idle pill, Stop, transcript/code execution.
  Backend: `GET /api/state`, `POST /api/turn`, `POST /api/turn/cancel`. Disk:
  `<fresh-data-dir>/active-turns.json` and `trace.jsonl`.
- Restate Admin SQL is `POST $ADMIN/query` with JSON `{ "query": "..." }`; KILL is
  `PATCH $ADMIN/invocations/<invocation-id>/kill` with an empty body.
- Teardown: `just agent-workbench-down <port>`.

## Phase 0 — Boot and identify the session

Poll `/healthz`, open the page, and require the startup warning names `exec-blocked` and
the rendered model id is `dev/failure-paths`. Record the rendered, API, and disk session
ids and require equality. Screenshot `00-break-glass-ready.png`.

## Phase 1 — Wedge one exact turn

Submit `enter the deterministic exec block`. Poll until all of these agree:

- the page is running, Stop is visible, and the Lashlang code/execution surface shows a
  foreground `sleep for "10m"` that has started but not completed;
- `/api/state.active_turns` contains exactly one address for the recorded session;
- `active-turns.json` contains that exact `session_id` and `turn_id`;
- `trace.jsonl` associates the same turn with the running code path.

Record the turn id. Screenshot `01-exec-blocked.png`; save state and matching trace rows
as `01-exec-blocked-state.json` and `01-exec-blocked-trace.json`.

Query Restate by the exact turn id, escaping it as a SQL string literal:

```sql
SELECT id, target_service_name, target_service_key, target_handler_name, status,
       completion_result, completion_failure
FROM sys_invocation
WHERE target_service_name = 'WorkbenchTurnWorkflow'
  AND target_service_key = '<exact-turn-id>'
  AND target_handler_name = 'run'
ORDER BY modified_at DESC
```

Require exactly one active row and save the query response as
`01-restate-invocation.json`. Its `target_service_key` must equal the UI/API turn id.

## Phase 2 — Admin-KILL the invocation

Send `PATCH $ADMIN/invocations/<exact-invocation-id>/kill`. Poll the exact invocation via
`$ADMIN/query` until its status is no longer `pending`, `ready`, `running`, `backing-off`,
or `suspended`. Save the response as `02-killed-invocation.json`.

Before touching Stop, gate that no source claims cancellation:

- the page does not render `turn cancelled` or `turn stopped · request`;
- `/api/state.messages` has no cancellation message for this turn;
- `trace.jsonl` has no committed outcome `cancelled` and no cancellation evidence for
  the killed turn.

The page may still show running because its persisted route is intentionally dangling.
Screenshot `02-killed-route-still-visible.png`.

## Phase 3 — Use Stop to prune the dangling route honestly

Press **stop turn** and capture `POST /api/turn/cancel`. The request includes the bounded
terminal attach, so poll the request itself with a browser timeout of at least 15 seconds.
Require exactly one cancellation receipt for the Phase 1 address with:

- `accepted: true` and a gate outcome of `requested` or `already_requested`;
- `terminal: null`;
- `terminal_error.code: "turn_terminal_await_timeout"`;
- no cancellation evidence anywhere in a terminal, because no terminal exists.

Require the page to render `turn route cleared · terminal outcome unknown`, return idle,
and hide Stop. `/api/state.active_turns` and `active-turns.json` must both be empty. The
page must still not say `Cancelled` or `turn stopped · request`. Save the receipt and
state as `03-pruned-receipt.json` and `03-pruned-state.json`; screenshot
`03-route-pruned-unknown.png`.

## Phase 4 — Prove same-session recovery

Without reset, restart, or teardown, submit `prove break-glass recovery`. Poll for the
exact assistant text `session recovered after break glass`, allowing up to 90 seconds for
the successor lease. Require the page to be idle, no active route, and the rendered/API
session id to equal Phase 0. The new turn id must differ from the killed turn id.

Require its trace outcome to be committed normally with no cancellation evidence.
Screenshot `04-same-session-recovered.png`; save state and trace rows as
`04-same-session-recovered-state.json` and `04-same-session-recovered-trace.json`.

## Phase 5 — Teardown and score

Run `just agent-workbench-down <port>` and confirm the Workbench and its port-derived
Restate container are gone.

| Item | Objective gate | Verdict | Evidence |
|------|----------------|---------|----------|
| Deterministic wedge | exact route is running in foreground ten-minute exec | | `01-exec-blocked.*` |
| Exact invocation | Restate row key equals active turn id | | `01-restate-invocation.json` |
| Admin KILL | exact invocation becomes non-active | | `02-killed-invocation.json` |
| No fabricated cancellation | UI/API/trace never report Cancelled or evidence | | `02-*`, `03-*` |
| Honest route pruning | null terminal + timeout code; unknown-terminal note; route clears | | `03-pruned-*` |
| Session recovery | same session commits exact second-call response | | `04-same-session-recovered-*` |
| Store-side negative | companion harness reports `break-glass-negative` passed | | harness log |
| Teardown | Workbench and derived Restate container gone | | command log |

**Aggregate:** did the operator kill only the wedged invocation, preserve the distinction
between owner destruction and cancellation, prune the stale route honestly, and recover
the same session for new work?
