# E2E Scenario: Workbench Runtime Processes — Session-Independent Lifecycle

> **Read [../RULES.md](../RULES.md) first** — especially the browser-surface,
> screenshot, polling, real-token, Abort/RCA, and teardown rules. This runbook adds only
> the Runtime Process lifecycle scenario.

**Purpose.** Prove the ADR 0019 boundary through the Agent Workbench: a Runtime Process
is runtime-owned, survives deletion of the session that started it, remains visible in
the host work rail, and persists its terminal state. Also prove the rail's Cancel control
records `process.cancel_requested` and settles a second process as cancelled through the
global work API.

**Real tokens.** The setup turn uses OpenRouter to define and start processes. Gate on
named process cards, process ids, durable lifecycle/event rows, and API/UI agreement—not
on surrounding model prose.

## Scenario-specific golden rules

1. **Both processes must be running first.** Do not delete the session until `/api/work`
   and the rendered rail show distinct `FIG425 survivor <run-id>` and
   `FIG425 cancellable <run-id>` process cards with non-terminal status.
2. **Delete the owner, not the runtime.** Use the workbench reset affordance (the API
   operation is `DELETE /api/session`; legacy `POST /api/reset` drives the same path).
   Never stop Restate, the process worker, or the web process during this scenario.
3. **The process rail is runtime-wide.** After deletion, the rendered session id must
   change while both original process ids remain visible through `/api/work`. A process
   visible only in a stale screenshot does not pass.
4. **Completion is durable.** The survivor must reach `completed`, with its terminal event
   retained in `<data-dir>/processes.db`, after its originating session store is gone.
5. **Cancel is cooperative and evidenced.** Use the cancellable card's **cancel** button.
   Require a `process.cancel_requested` event followed by a `cancelled` terminal for that
   exact process id. Killing a Restate invocation is not a substitute.

## Working material

- Boot with a fresh durable directory:
  `AGENT_WORKBENCH_DATA_DIR=<fresh-tmp> AGENT_WORKBENCH_OPEN=0 just agent-workbench <port>`.
  Gate `GET /healthz` → 200. Teardown: `just agent-workbench-down <port>`.
- Browser affordances: chat composer, work rail, per-process **cancel**, reset/new-session
  control, rendered session id.
- Backend truth: `GET /api/state`, `GET /api/work`, `POST
  /api/work/{process_id}/cancel`, and `DELETE /api/session` (or the reset control's
  equivalent `POST /api/reset`).
- Disk truth: `<data-dir>/processes.db` tables `processes`, `process_events`, and
  `process_handle_grants`; `<data-dir>/lash-sessions/`; `<data-dir>/trace.jsonl` event
  `agent_workbench.reset.restate.session_deleted`, whose report names orphaned process
  ids.

## Phase 0 — Boot and record owner identity

Require `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`; a missing key is a harness gap → Abort. Boot, poll
`/healthz`, open the browser, and require the rendered session id to match
`/api/state.settings.session_id` and `<data-dir>/session-id`. Record it as the owner
session id. Screenshot `00-ready.png`.

## Phase 1 — Start two durable Runtime Processes

Ask the agent to define and start two explicitly named Lashlang Runtime Processes in one
turn:

- `FIG425 survivor <run-id>` waits roughly 30 seconds, then finishes successfully with a
  literal terminal marker;
- `FIG425 cancellable <run-id>` waits several minutes, then finishes with a marker that
  must never be reached.

Poll `/api/work` until both named rows are non-terminal, capture their full process ids,
and require matching running cards in the rendered work rail. Verify `processes.db`
contains both ids and handle grants for the owner session. Save `01-running-work.json`
and the relevant database extraction as `01-running-store.json`; screenshot
`01-two-running-processes.png`.

## Phase 2 — Delete the originating session

Use the reset/new-session control while capturing its HTTP response, or issue
`DELETE /api/session` from the browser context. Poll until:

- the rendered and `/api/state` session id changes;
- the old session's database is absent from `<data-dir>/lash-sessions/`;
- the session-deleted trace report contains both original process ids as orphaned;
- `process_handle_grants` has no grants for the deleted session;
- `/api/work` and the rendered work rail still show both original process ids.

The last item is the judged crown-jewel checkpoint: screenshot the new session identity
and still-live process cards together as `02-owner-gone-processes-live.png`. Save the API,
trace, and database extracts as `02-after-delete-*.json`.

## Phase 3 — Cancel one orphan through the work rail

Press **cancel** on `FIG425 cancellable <run-id>` and capture the response as
`03-cancel-receipt.json`; require `accepted: true` and the exact process id. Poll
`/api/work` until that card is terminal/cancelled and its event tail includes
`process.cancel_requested`. Require the same ordered evidence in `process_events` and
require that the forbidden finish marker is absent. Screenshot
`03-orphan-cancelled.png`.

## Phase 4 — Let the survivor complete

Without opening or recreating the deleted session, poll until `FIG425 survivor <run-id>`
is terminal/completed in `/api/work` and in the rendered rail. Require its terminal
success event and literal finish marker in `processes.db`; re-query after one more work
refresh to prove the terminal is retained rather than transient. Screenshot
`04-survivor-completed.png`; save `04-terminal-work.json` and
`04-terminal-store.json`.

## Phase 5 — Teardown and score

Run `just agent-workbench-down <port>` and confirm the workbench and its Restate
container are gone.

| Item | Objective gate | Verdict | Evidence |
|------|----------------|---------|----------|
| Processes started | two named non-terminal ids agree in rail, API, and store | | `01-two-running-processes.png`, `01-running-*.json` |
| Owner deleted | new rendered/API session id; old store/grants gone | | `02-owner-gone-processes-live.png`, `02-after-delete-*.json` |
| Runtime independence | both original ids remain live in rail and `/api/work` after delete | | `02-owner-gone-processes-live.png`, API/trace report |
| Global cancel | exact id accepted; `cancel_requested` then cancelled | | `03-orphan-cancelled.png`, `03-cancel-receipt.json`, store events |
| Survivor completion | completed terminal and finish marker persist after owner deletion | | `04-survivor-completed.png`, `04-terminal-*.json` |
| No break-glass substitution | no Restate Admin cancel/kill used | | command log |

**Aggregate:** did the workbench visibly and durably preserve Runtime Process ownership at
the runtime layer after deleting its originating session, including both natural
completion and cooperative cancellation?
