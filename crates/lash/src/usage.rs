//! Token usage tracking surfaces.
//!
//! Four channels, finest granularity to coarsest:
//!
//! - **`TraceSink`**: every provider call across every session in the
//!   runtime. Right for billing, audit, off-line analysis. Heavier than
//!   necessary if you only want totals. See [`crate::tracing`].
//! - **[`TurnEvent::Usage`] / [`TurnEvent::ChildUsage`]**: live during a
//!   turn, one event per LLM iteration. `Usage` is the parent's own
//!   model call; `ChildUsage` carries `session_id` + `source` so a UI can
//!   group child traffic (e.g. by subagent). Right for live counters.
//! - **[`TurnResult::usage`] / [`TurnResult::children_usage`]**: per-turn
//!   snapshot at completion. `usage` is parent-only; `children_usage` is a
//!   per-`(source, model)` breakdown. [`TurnResult::total_usage`] sums both.
//!   Right for "what did this message cost."
//! - **[`SessionUsageReport`]** (`session.usage_report()`): aggregate
//!   across the whole session, broken down by `source` × `model`. Right for
//!   dashboards and "session so far."
//!
//! Usage buckets are provider-normalized before they reach these surfaces:
//! `input_tokens` is uncached ordinary input, `cache_read_input_tokens` is
//! cached prompt input read from the provider cache, `cache_write_input_tokens`
//! is prompt input written to the provider cache, and `output_tokens` is total
//! generated output. `reasoning_output_tokens` is a subset of output tokens,
//! not an extra total component. `TokenUsage::total()` therefore sums ordinary
//! input, output, cache reads, and cache writes.
