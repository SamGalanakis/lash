//! The shared async connection wrapper over [`tokio_rusqlite::Connection`].
//!
//! Every module in this crate talks to SQLite through [`SqliteConnection`]:
//! a single cheaply-clonable handle whose database operations all run on the
//! connection's own background thread via [`tokio_rusqlite::Connection::call`].
//!
//! ## Why a wrapper and not raw `tokio_rusqlite::Connection`
//!
//! Three concerns are centralised here so the porter modules stay terse and
//! consistent:
//!
//! * **WAL + busy-timeout setup.** Real SQLite WAL (the entire point of the
//!   rusqlite swap) needs `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL` plus a generous
//!   `busy_timeout` so contending processes wait instead of failing. [`open`]
//!   and [`open_in_memory`] apply these once on the connection thread.
//!
//! * **`IMMEDIATE` write transactions.** rusqlite's `Connection::transaction`
//!   opens `BEGIN DEFERRED`, which only takes the write lock on the first write
//!   statement. Every read-then-write path the crate promises to serialise
//!   cross-process (head-revision CAS, lease fencing, the queued-work claim)
//!   must therefore use [`SqliteConnection::write`], which opens
//!   `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` so the write lock is acquired up front and a contending
//!   writer waits on the busy timeout instead of reading a stale snapshot.
//!
//! * **Error mapping.** `conn.call(...)` returns [`tokio_rusqlite::Error`],
//!   which wraps [`rusqlite::Error`]. The helpers flatten that so closures only
//!   ever deal in `rusqlite::Result<T>` and callers receive the inner
//!   `rusqlite::Error` to feed through `sqlite_error` / `process_sqlite_error`.
