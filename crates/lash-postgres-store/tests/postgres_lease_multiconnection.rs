//! Live, multi-connection process-lease clock/fencing evidence.
//!
//! The single-pool conformance suite (`tests/conformance.rs`) forces lease
//! expiry with `ttl_ms = 0` rather than by elapsed time, and the clock-contract
//! test only string-scans the source. Neither exercises two *independent*
//! connections competing for one lease under real time. This test does, proving
//! the property the DB-clock design exists to guarantee: worker wall-clock skew
//! can neither steal a live lease nor spuriously expire one, because every lease
//! decision reads `now` from the database clock (`clock_timestamp()` via
//! `process_lease_now_epoch_ms_tx`), not from any caller.
//!
//! ## App-wall-clock investigation (task step 1)
//!
//! The lease paths were grepped for `current_epoch_ms` and for client-supplied
//! timestamps flowing into the lease SQL. Finding: **lease validity is purely
//! database-time driven.** The client-facing API — `claim_process_lease`,
//! `reclaim_process_lease`, `renew_process_lease`, `complete_process_with_lease`
//! — never accepts an absolute wall-clock instant; it takes only a TTL
//! *duration* (`lease_ttl_ms`). Inside each method `now` comes from
//! `process_lease_now_epoch_ms_tx` (the DB clock), and `guard_lease` compares
//! the *DB-persisted* lease's `expires_at_epoch_ms` against DB-now — never the
//! caller's copy of the lease. The `expires_at_epoch_ms` / `claimed_at_epoch_ms`
//! fields carried inside a `ProcessLease` handed back to the client are outputs,
//! not validity inputs: on renew/complete only the `(owner, lease_token,
//! fencing_token)` triple is matched. (The `current_epoch_ms()` calls elsewhere
//! in the registry stamp `updated_at_ms` bookkeeping / `first_started` /
//! abandon-request metadata — none gate lease validity.)
//!
//! Because a client-supplied time genuinely cannot influence lease validity,
//! this test proves that fact directly with a deliberately skewed client value:
//! it forges a copy of the stale host's lease whose `expires_at_epoch_ms` is a
//! decade in the future and shows the database still rejects its renew/complete.
//! The two independent "hosts" whose local wall clocks are never consulted are
//! themselves the skew evidence: only database time decides.
