# Durable background process execution

**Status:** implemented. A background process is identically durable however it
is started: start writes durable intent, and a lash-owned `DurableProcessWorker`
is the *sole* executor of every non-terminal process, behind a single-owner
`ProcessLease`. There is no off-lease in-process spawn — out-of-turn starts no
longer run on a detached `tokio::spawn`. The registry's non-terminal rows are the
durable work queue, and a `ProcessWorkRunner` drains them **on poke, on a poll
tick, and once at startup**. So the *first* run of a trigger / host-event start is
itself lease-protected and prompt (a poke fires after the start), not merely
eventually recovered by the next restart's sweep. This closes the turn-vs-trigger
asymmetry — trigger / host-event starts run durably and recover on crash, exactly
like turn-started ones — and removes the double-execution window the startup-only
sweep left open. The one remaining gap is cron *activation*: a cron tick has no
host-side scheduler driving it yet, but the moment a tick fires a process start,
that process inherits the same lease-protected execution + recovery (see
`.todos.md`). This note records the design and principle; the *Implementation*
section below maps it to the code that shipped.

## Problem (the asymmetry this resolved)

A background `process` can be started three ways:

- **in a turn** — the model emits `start name(...)` while a turn runs;
- **by a trigger** — a host event (`session.host_events().emit(...)`) fans out to
  one or more `process` starts via installed trigger routes;
- **by cron** — a schedule tick.

Before this work, only the first was durably re-executed in a Restate
deployment, and the asymmetry was silent.

Durability of execution used to be borrowed from the **turn-local controller
scope**. A turn run with `stream_with_durable_turn(scope)` threaded the
Restate-backed controller into process control via a silent
`effect_controller.unwrap_or(current.host.core.effect_controller)` fallback, so a
turn's `start name(...)` scheduled a `LashProcessWorkflow` invocation that
Restate re-invoked on crash — but a trigger or cron tick fires **outside** a
turn. `emit_host_event` (`runtime/session_ops.rs`) is a session-control op with
no scope, so its process starts hit that fallback and ran on the **build-time**
controller — necessarily `InlineRuntimeEffectController` in a Restate deployment
(the Restate-backed controller is constructed per-invocation from a Restate
`ctx`, so it can never be a process-global build-time controller). The inline
path `tokio::spawn`ed the process and dropped the `JoinHandle`: the run completed
in-process under normal operation, but the spawn held **no lease**, so a recovery
sweep on another node or after a restart could re-run a process already running
(the off-lease/double-exec window), and on crash the in-memory task was gone with
**no prompt re-execution** — only the next restart's startup sweep would re-run
it. Registry rows — record, events, grants, wake inbox — survived a restart; the
*execution* was either off-lease or merely eventually-recovered.

The fix removes that silent fallback **and** the off-lease spawn. Process control
now routes through the controller the host **explicitly wired** for the path, and
a `Start` only *registers* the durable row; the lease-protected
`DurableProcessWorker` — driven promptly by a `ProcessWorkRunner` — is the single
executor for all out-of-turn process work. A durable host never silently
re-executes a process on an inline controller, and no process ever runs without
holding its `ProcessLease`.

## Principle

lash's thesis is that **the runtime is the durable end** — it already owns the
turn's `RuntimeTurnLease` + checkpoint + effect journal + `resume_turn`, with the
host supplying only the backend (Restate `ctx`, SQLite registry/store). Process
execution should follow the same split: **lash owns the durability logic; the
host supplies the backend.**

## What the OpenAI Agents SDK does — and why it is the wrong template

The OpenAI Agents Python SDK draws the boundary in the opposite place. Its
durability primitive is `RunState`: a run interrupts (e.g. a human-in-the-loop
tool approval), the host calls `result.to_state()`, serializes it
(`to_string()`/`to_json()`), **persists it itself**, and later resumes via
`Runner.run(agent, state)`. The SDK owns only the serialization surface and the
resume entry point; the host owns when/where to persist, when to re-drive, and
idempotency. There is no background/trigger/cron process concept — "long
running" means host-driven pause/resume; Temporal integration lives in the
orchestrator, not the SDK.

That is coherent because the SDK is a **stateless request/response agent loop** —
durability genuinely is not its job. Copying it into lash would (a) contradict
the "durable runtime" thesis and (b) push lease/recovery/idempotency onto every
host *per background process*. Right answer for a thin stateless SDK; wrong
answer for a durable runtime with first-class background processes, triggers,
and cron.

## Rejected: emitter-supplied durable turn scopes

The tempting stopgap is to let the emitter carry a durable scope, mirroring the
turn API. It is the wrong layer:

- it couples a process's durability to **whoever emitted the event**;
- it does not generalize to **cron**, which has no emitter to carry a scope;
- it conflates "produce start intent" with "execute it durably."

Adding it would ossify an emitter-carries-durability model exactly where the
clean worker-owns-execution-durability model belongs.

## Design: separate intent from execution

**1. Start = durable intent, full stop.** `start name(...)` in a turn, a trigger
firing, and a cron tick each do one thing: write a durable process record +
grant (+ causal session node) to the registry. The rows survive restart. None
of these paths carries an execution scope.

**2. Execution = a lash-owned durable worker with a per-process lease +
recovery.** Mirrors the turn model 1:1:

| Unit    | Single-owner lease | Resumable state             | Recovery entry         |
| ------- | ------------------ | --------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Turn    | `RuntimeTurnLease` | checkpoint + effect journal | `resume_turn`          |
| Process | `ProcessLease`     | registry events + journal   | `drive_pending_processes` (poke/poll/startup) |

The `DurableProcessWorker` — the Restate execution authority via
`RestateCoreProcessRunner` / `LashProcessWorkflow` — is the single executor for
**all** non-terminal registered processes, regardless of how they were started.
It:

- claims a per-process execution lease (single-owner, renewable, expiring);
- runs the process through the host-supplied durable controller;
- on startup / deploy / lease expiry, **sweeps the registry for non-terminal,
  unleased processes and (re-)runs them.**

**3. Host supplies the backend; lash owns the durability logic** — exactly as
with turns. The host wires the SQLite registry and runs the worker (under
Restate, the worker handler is a workflow Restate re-invokes). The host does not
re-implement recovery, leasing, or idempotency per deployment.

This deletes the asymmetry: a trigger- or cron-started process is identically
durable to a turn-started one, because all three are just registered intent that
the durable worker executes. "How it was started" leaves the durability story
entirely.

## The primitive (a process-side mirror of the turn machinery)

A generalization of code that already existed for turns — not a new subsystem:

- **`ProcessLease`** — claim / renew / expire, single-owner, so a recovered
  process is not double-run across nodes. Mirrors `RuntimeTurnLease`:
  `schema_version`, `process_id`, `owner_id`, `lease_token`, `fencing_token`,
  `claimed_at_epoch_ms`, `expires_at_epoch_ms`, plus `ProcessLeaseCompletion`.
  The owner / lease-token / fencing-token triple is the distributed
  single-owner contract. Implemented on `SqliteProcessRegistry` (durable,
  fencing CAS) and `TestLocalProcessRegistry` (in-memory).
- **`ProcessRegistry::list_non_terminal()`** — the worklist query: the
  non-terminal rows *are* the durable work queue, alongside the claim / renew /
  complete lease ops.
- **`DurableProcessWorker::drive_pending_processes`** — one lease-protected
  drive: it lists non-terminal processes, claims each lease (skipping any held
  live by another owner), re-checks terminality after claiming, runs the claimed
  process on the worker's wired controller while renewing the lease across the
  execution (model: `renew_runtime_turn_lease_for_effect`), then writes the
  terminal outcome and releases the lease. Idempotent by `process_id`: terminal
  processes are never on the worklist, and a process that became terminal between
  the list and the claim is detected and skipped.
- **`ProcessWorkRunner` + `ProcessWorkPoke`** — the loop that *drives*
  `drive_pending_processes` promptly: a `tokio::select!` over a `Notify` (poke)
  and a poll interval, plus one startup drive that folds in what used to be a
  separate boot-time recovery sweep. A `ProcessRunHandle` selects the tier: the
  inline handle delegates to the worker's `drive_pending_processes`; the Restate
  handle fences-submits `LashProcessWorkflow/{process_id}` per non-terminal row.
  The control seam pokes after every successful `Start` — idempotently, since the
  runner skips leased/terminal rows and the durable submit is keyed-idempotent —
  so in-turn-inline, trigger, host-event, and cron starts are all driven the same
  way. The poke handle lives on the runtime host, not the trait-object controller.

## Idempotency

Two layers, both in place. **Start-idempotency**: the registry's `process_id`
uniqueness is the replay boundary for process control issued outside a turn
lease (see the comment at `process_runners/control.rs` — "process
registry/workflow idempotency is the replay boundary when a process control call
is issued outside an active turn lease"). **Execution-idempotency**: the
`ProcessLease` ensures a recovered, non-terminal process is re-run by exactly
one owner. Process execution identity is the persisted `process_id` end-to-end
(the Restate invocation is already keyed `LashProcessWorkflow/{process_id}`); a
retry — a Restate `run` re-invocation or a recovery sweep — must present that
stable id, and an empty/fresh id is rejected loudly
(`DurableProcessWorker::ensure_stable_process_id`), mirroring how
`DurableTurnScope::new` rejects an empty turn id.

## Non-goals

- Not "make every emitter supply a durable turn scope".
- Not "the host re-implements recovery" (the OpenAI `RunState` model).
- Not exactly-once side effects inside a process beyond what the existing effect
  journal/replay provides for turns — the same at-least-once-with-idempotency
  semantics apply.

## Implementation

Durability is a property of each execution path, derived from what the host
wired — there is no mode flag. Each trait that touches the substrate carries a
defaulted `durability_tier()` returning `DurabilityTier::Inline`; durable host
implementations override it to `Durable`. The runtime never silently runs
nondeterministic work on a non-durable controller picked as a fallback, and a
durable controller paired with any ephemeral store fails **loudly** at the
boundary where the tier is known:

- **Scope boundary** (`turn_loop.rs`, resume/stream turn-scoped): when the
  turn's controller is `Durable`, all wired stores must be `Durable`, else
  `DurableSubstrateRequired { facet }`.
- **Worker boundary** (`DurableProcessWorker::ensure_durable_substrate`): the
  same check at process-run / runtime rebuild.
- **Facade build** (`lash/src/core.rs::ensure_store_peer_coherence`): store
  peer-coherence only — the per-invocation durable controller is not visible at
  build, so build checks the stores against each other (durable session store
  ⇒ durable attachment + artifact store; durable process registry ⇒ durable
  session store factory), never the controller.

Out-of-turn starts (host-event triggers in `session/triggers.rs`; facade
`start`/`cancel`; `api.rs`) write durable intent and execute via the worker. The
silent `effect_controller.unwrap_or(...)` fallback at
`process_runners/control.rs` is gone — out of turn there is no scope controller,
so the host's explicitly-named build-time controller is used. A `Start` only
*registers* the row (the `InlineRuntimeEffectController`'s off-lease
`tokio::spawn` is deleted), and `execute_process_effect` pokes the host's
`ProcessWorkRunner` after a successful `Start`. The runner is wired by the host:
the `lash` facade lazily spawns a default inline runner on first
`session().open()` when a process registry **and** a store factory are present
(it cannot rebuild session runtimes without one), suppressed by an explicit
`with_process_work_runner(...)` and guarded by
`EmbedError::ProcessRegistryWithoutWorkRunner` when the default is disabled with
no replacement; a Restate deployment registers the ingress-client runner at the
serve path (`lash-restate/src/lib.rs`) and hands the core its poke.

An emitter-supplied durability API was **not** added — the worker owns execution
durability, not the emitter.

### Subagent collapse

A subagent spawn is now itself a process that runs a child lash session,
collapsed onto the generic `ProcessInput::SessionTurn` primitive
(`process_runners/session.rs::run_process_session_turn`). `agents.spawn`
(`crates/lash-subagents`) builds a `SessionCreateRequest` (capability → policy,
seed → initial nodes, RLM termination → plugin options, depth ceiling →
hidden tools) plus a `TurnInput`, and emits one `ProcessInput::SessionTurn` —
all deltas are request **config**, not new structure. The bespoke parallel
child-creation path (`rlm.rs::run_child_session`, the dead
`SubagentSessionConfigurator` / `NoopSubagentSessionConfigurator`) is deleted.
Because children now flow through the same generic path Phases A/B made durable,
they inherit provider re-supply, durability, and recovery — which is what
dissolves the `rlm_spawn` provider-inheritance failure: there is no bespoke
route left to drop the live provider handle. Recursion safety
(`MAX_SUBAGENT_DEPTH`, tool-hiding at the depth ceiling) and the `submit_error`
terminal are carried as request config / tool-access, not lost.
