# ADR 0002: Session Observation Uses Cursors And Bounded Live Replay

Status: accepted

## Context

Lash has two different observation needs:

- Durable session state for settled UI and host reconciliation.
- Live semantic activity for one running turn.

`SessionReadView` already represents the durable projection. `TurnActivity` already represents per-turn semantic activity such as prose deltas, reasoning, tools, usage, and errors. Reconnect/resume should not make `TurnActivity` a durable history API, and it should not require a cursor scoped to a request or turn.

## Decision

Reconnect is session-level. A host observes a `SessionObservation`: the current `SessionReadView` plus an opaque `SessionCursor`.

`SessionObservationEvent` advances that cursor. Events may wrap `TurnActivity`, but they can also represent session commits, Agent Frame switches, queued-work changes, process changes, or replay gaps. `SessionRevision` names the durable committed point: the store `head_revision` for persisted sessions and a process-local revision for in-memory sessions.

Live replay is best-effort and bounded. `LiveReplayStore` is not `RuntimePersistence`, not durable history, and not required to survive process loss. The default `InMemoryLiveReplayStore` keeps at most 2048 events or 120 seconds per session. Hosts that need a deployment-specific buffer can pass a custom store through `LashCoreBuilder::live_replay_store`.

`SessionCursor` is opaque outside core. Malformed cursors are invalid input. Cursors for a different session are rejected. Stale or trimmed cursors return a fresh `SessionObservation` plus `LiveReplayGap`.

## Consequences

`TurnBuilder::stream_to`, pull-style `stream`, `run`, and `TurnOutput.activities` remain turn convenience APIs. They are not the reconnect surface.

Remote protocol turn requests no longer carry a turn-level activity cursor field. `RemoteTurnActivity.sequence` remains only per-stream ordering. Remote session observation uses `RemoteSessionCursor`, `RemoteSessionObservation`, `RemoteSessionObservationEvent`, and `RemoteLiveReplayGap`; the protocol does not serialize a full `SessionReadView`.

Live replay append failures must not fail turn execution or durable commits. They are logged, and later reconnect falls back to gap recovery from durable state.
