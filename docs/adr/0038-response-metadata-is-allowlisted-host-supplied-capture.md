# Response metadata is allowlisted host-supplied capture

The typed success-result boundary was lossy. OpenAI-compatible drivers received response headers
but retained only `x-request-id`, while unmodeled top-level body members disappeared when the
wire response became an `LlmResponse`. A host that needed a provider receipt therefore had to
decorate the transport, observe the response out of band, and correlate that observation back to
the completed call. `RemoteProviderMetadata.data` did not close the gap: outbound conversions
always created it empty and inbound conversions discarded it.

We decided that **wire metadata capture is explicit, allowlisted, and supplied by the host**.
`LlmResponse.response_metadata` is a map of raw JSON values. OpenAI-compatible endpoint config
may allowlist case-insensitive response header names and JSON pointers into response bodies.
Captured headers use `header:<lowercased-name>` keys; captured body values use
`body:<json-pointer>` keys. Buffered responses probe the final body, while streaming responses
probe every JSON SSE event and retain the last observed value for a pointer. Both allowlists are
empty by default, and other provider drivers continue to produce an empty map until they expose
their own explicit endpoint configuration.

Lash provides only the capture mechanism. The host owns the meaning of every captured value,
consistent with the host-policy boundary in ADR 0033: core contains no gateway-specific keys or
parsers and no typed cost field. In particular, there is no dump-all mode. Durable results must
not silently absorb cookies, authentication-adjacent headers, unbounded diagnostic values, or
high-cardinality wire data. A value enters `response_metadata` only because the host named its
header or JSON pointer on that endpoint.

Capture follows the attempt result. A successful response carries observations from its final
assembled response path, and a failed streaming attempt's partial response carries observations
accumulated before failure, just as it carries provider request identity and partial usage. HTTP
error-status responses remain unchanged because their error envelope already carries the full
response headers. The remote protocol now transports the map through
`RemoteProviderMetadata.data` in both directions using deterministic `BTreeMap` ordering instead
of manufacturing an empty map and discarding it on return.

We rejected adding a separate correlation token for transport decorators. Once the observation
travels in-band on the typed response or partial response, a second correlation mechanism is
obsolete and would preserve the workaround rather than the missing seam. We accept that direct
Anthropic and Google endpoint configs will duplicate these allowlist fields when those drivers
adopt capture later. This is the same per-provider configuration trade accepted for stream
termination in ADR 0036: explicit dialect contracts are preferable to inference or a global
transport policy.
